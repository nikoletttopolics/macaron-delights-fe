    <h1 style="margin-bottom: 0">The history of Macarons</h1>
    <p>
      The fascinating origin of the macaron can be traced back to Italy during
      the Renaissance period. At the time, the macaron was a small, almond-based
      cookie that was crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside. The cookie
      was made from almond flour, egg whites, and sugar, and was often flavoured
      with vanilla or citrus.
    </p>
    <p style="margin: 0">
      In the 16th century Catherine de Medici, the wife of King Henry II of
      France, introduced her beloved macarons to the French. When she married
      the French king, she brought her Italian pastry chefs with her to France,
      who presented the macaron to the French aristocracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The macaron became a popular treat among the French nobility, and many
      French pastry chefs began experimenting with the recipe and developing
      their own unique flavours.

    <h1>There are two ways of making Macarons</h1>
    <p>
      The first is the Italian method, which involves whisking egg whites with
      heated sugar syrup to achieve a meringue. Icing sugar and sited almond
      flour are added and mixed with the egg to form a paste. This forms the
      macaron mixture.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second method is the French method, which involves whisking egg whites
      until it forms a stiff-peaked meringue. Powdered sugar and almond flour
      are then added slowly and mixed to achieve the desired consistency.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Italian meringue is the most effective to make macarons, and gives
      consistent results.
