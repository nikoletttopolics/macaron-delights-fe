    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Hi! I'm a junior frontend developer with a strong interest in building
      responsive and user-friendly web applications using modern technologies.
      Iâ€™m passionate about clean code, scalable architectures, and continuous
      learning. This macaron webshop is my very first full-stack project, and I
      created it from scratch to both challenge myself and demonstrate my skills
      as a developer.

    <h1>About This Project</h1>
    <p>
      This macaron webshop is a full-stack e-commerce application I developed as
      a personal portfolio project. It simulates a real online store, featuring
      product listings, a shopping cart, and order management. My goal with this
      project was to gain hands-on experience with professional frontend
      development patterns and state management while also learning how to build
      and connect a backend.
    </p>
    <p>
      The application is built using Angular for the frontend with NgRx for
      state management and RxJS for handling asynchronous operations. It
      communicates with a Node.js and Express backend, which interacts with a
      SQL database to manage products and cart data. The layout is responsive
      and styled using Angular Material, maintaining a playful yet clean design
      that reflects the brand of a macaron store.
